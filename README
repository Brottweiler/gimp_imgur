A very simple gimp plugin to upload the current image anonymously to Imgur.

To install simply copy whichever files you want into your GIMP plug-in directoy.  Normally located in <GIMP Install>/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins
Make sure that the files are executable.

This has only been tested in GIMP 2.8 on Windows 7.
